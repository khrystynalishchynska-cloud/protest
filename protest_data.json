Images of pastel-colored canopies clustered outside government headquarters in Admiralty – and later across Mong Kok and Causeway Bay – spread worldwide, capturing the movement’s creativity and determination. <span class=strong-emphasis> Yellow umbrellas, especially, became shorthand for the cause:</span> they appeared in protest art, were projected onto skyscrapers, and even inspired the 3-metre-tall <span class=strong-emphasis>“Umbrella Man”</span> statue erected in the occupied streets. Beyond defence, umbrellas served as makeshift banners for slogans such as “I want real <span class=\"highlight-cause\">democracy</span>,” and were lashed together into improvised barricades or held high to shield protesters’ faces from surveillance cameras. The symbolism soon travelled: activists in <span class=empasisc> <span class=\"highlight-country\"> Myanmar</span></span>,  <span class=empasisc> <span class=\"highlight-country\"> Thailand,</span> </span> and elsewhere have since wielded umbrellas in their own demonstrations, using them both for physical protection and as a vivid visual link to <span class=empasisc> <span class=\"highlight-country\">Hong Kong</span>’s</span> precedent. <br>"
