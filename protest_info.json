    "summary": "The Umbrella Movement was a 79-day pro-democracy protest that occupied major districts of Hong Kong from September 26 to December 15, 2014. The movement took its name from the umbrellas protesters used to shield themselves from police pepper spray and tear gas, becoming one of the most significant demonstrations in the city's history.​ The protests were primarily driven by demands for genuine universal suffrage in the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, opposing the Chinese government's decision to pre-screen candidates.​",
